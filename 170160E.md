Smart contracts allow the creation of digital contracts which executes when predetermined conditions are met, without the need of a trusted third party. 

# 2. Permissioned blockchain
Unlike in public-permissionless blockchains like Bitcoin or  Ethereum, permissioned blockchain doen't require costly mining to achieve consensus. Therefore a native cryptocurrency is not needed to incent mining or fuel smart contracts. Still, participants in the permissioned blockchain may not be fully trusted, but the blockchain can be operated under a separate governance model such as a legal agreement.
